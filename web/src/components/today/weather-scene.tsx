/**
 * The card's background: a real sky photograph for the current conditions,
 * with the weather moving over it.
 *
 * Four layers, and the top one is conditional. A gradient paints instantly and
 * shows through while the photo decodes; the photograph (public/sky, Wikimedia
 * originals, served responsively by next/image) carries the realism; then
 * either a filmed loop of the real weather (public/sky/video, chosen per
 * forecast condition in the sky lab) or — where no clip is pinned for that
 * condition — WeatherCanvas drawing rain, snow, lightning and cloud haze.
 *
 * Never both: footage of rain under drawn rain is two different downpours at
 * two different angles. Both only mount once we know the viewer welcomes
 * motion, since a paused video still downloads.
